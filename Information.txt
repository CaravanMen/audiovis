Kinda cool, eh?

I don't actually know if its 100% accurate, but it seems so, and as such, imma jus roll with it! (I could measure the waves tho.)

This was made in raw OpenGL, C++, Pulseaudio API (the linux audio server I think), and finally, the FFTW3 library. (I could do the Fourier Transformation research, but that'd take a while.... So I jus used an API)
Shaders are technically loaded LIVE, and are seperate from the program, which is rlly cool, bc I can change them without recompiling!
